<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This to-do list app is a simple and convenient tool for managing tasks. The app uses localStorage to save tasks, so they will remain on the list even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page.

The app has a task counter that displays the number of tasks on the list, and allows users to easily add new tasks using the "Add" button. When a task is completed, users can mark it off by clicking the "Completed" button, which removes the task from the list.
